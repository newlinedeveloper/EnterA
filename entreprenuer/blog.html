			  			<div class="ui header">
			  				Step 1: Pick a blog name
			  			</div>
			  			<div class="description">
			  				<p>The first step to finding a good blog name is choosing your topic.</p>
			  				<p>If you’re not sure what to blog about, there are a few ways to find a good blog topic:</p>
			  				<span class="ui header">Hobbies & passions.</span>
			  				<p>Hobbies or other interests you are passionate about are a great place to start. Cooking, travel, fashion, sports, and cars are all classic examples. But even blogs about more obscure hobbies can be successful, since the your audience is literally anyone in the world with the internet. </p>

			  				<span class="ui header">Life experiences.</span>
			  				<p>Everyone has lessons they have learned through life experience. Sharing this knowledge can be incredibly helpful to others in similar situations. For example, I recently helped a woman start her blog about being a fireman’s wife. She has a lot of experience and knowledge to share with others about this topic, and it has helped her connect with others in similar situations.Think about the things you have experienced in life. This could be related to your family (example: a blog about being a stay at home mom), work (a blog about experiences dealing with clients), or other life experiences (a blog about dealing with a troubling time such as a disease or divorce, or about a happy time such as preparing for a wedding or a birth of a child). </p>

			  				<span class="ui header">A personal blog. </span>
			  				<p>A personal blog is a blog all about you. This will include a variety of topics, from things you do on a daily basis, to random thoughts and musings. This is a great way to share you thoughts with the world without having to stick to just one topic. </p>

			  				<span class="ui header">A good blog name should be descriptive </span>
			  				<p>If you are blogging about one specific topic then you will definitely want to include that in some way in your blog name. Try not to get hung-up on just one word though. For example, a cooking blog doesn’t necessarily have to have the word “cooking” in it. The words “food”, “recipes”, and “meals” would also let people know that your blog is about cooking.</p>


			  				
			  			</div>

			  		<div class="content" style="margin: 10px">
			  			<div class="ui header">
			  				Step 2: Get your blog online
			  			</div>
			  			<div class="description">
			  				<p>Now that you’ve got a name picked out it’s time to get your blog online. This might sound hard or technical, but the steps below will walk you right through and make the process easy.</p>

			  				<p>
			  					To get your blog up and running you need two things: blog hosting and blogging software. The good news is that these typically come packaged together.
			  				</p>
			  				<p>
			  					A blog host is a company that stores all of the files for your blog and delivers them to the user when they type in your blog name. You must have a blog host in order to have a blog.
			  				</p>

			  				<p>
			  					You also need to have the software to build your blog. In this guide I will be showing you how to build a blog using the WordPress blogging software, because it is the most popular, customizable, and easiest to use.

			  				</p>

			  				<p>
			  					The blog host I recommend, and the one I show you how to use in this guide, is BlueHost. I personally use BlueHost and I recommend them for all new bloggers because:
			  				</p>
			  				<p>
			  					<ul>
			  						<li>They will register your blog name for you for free, making sure no one else can take it. </li>
			  						<li>They offer a free, simple installation of the WordPress blogging software (which I show you how to use in this guide). </li>
			  						<li>They have been recommended by WordPress since 2005 and currently host over 2 million blogs and websites. </li>
			  						<li>They have helpful 24/7 customer service via phone or web chat. </li>
			  						<li>They have a money-back guarantee if you are unsatisfied for any reason. </li>
			  					</ul>
			  				</p>

			  				<p>Use any BlueHost link on this site by January 12th to make sure you get the special BlueHost New Year’s Sale price of $2.75 per month.</p>

			  		<div class="content" style="margin: 10px">
			  			<div class="ui header">
			  				Step 3: Customize your blog
			  			</div>
			  			<div class="description">
			  				<span class="ui header">Logging in</span>

			  				<p>If you are not already logged-in, go to Bluehost.com and click “Login” on the top right to bring up the login screen.  You can then login using your domain name and the password you set in the previous step.  If you have misplaced your password you can reset it by clicking the “Forgot Password” link.</p>

			  				<p>
			  					Once you log-in you will be taken to your BlueHost Portal.  From the portal you can click “Log in to WordPress” to be logged-in automatically to your blog.
			  				</p>

			  				<span class="ui header">Changing your blog design</span>

			  				<p>
			  					Once you login you will be in the WordPress administrator area. This is where you can make any changes you want to your blog.
			  				</p>

			  				<p>Everyone has a different idea of how they want their blog to look. One of the great things about a WordPress blog is that you can change your entire layout and design with just a few clicks.</p>

			  				<p>You will see several themes are already installed on your blog: Twenty Seventeen, Twenty Sixteen, etc. These are well-designed, clean-looking themes that can work for just about any type of blog. In fact, many of the world’s top bloggers use one of these themes.</p>

			  				<p>Unless you have a very specific design in mind for your blog, I suggest you use one of these themes to start with. For our example, let’s use the “Twenty Sixteen” theme. In order to activate the theme on your blog, hover over the theme and click the “Activate” button. That’s it! You have changed the entire design of your blog with just one click!</p>

			  			<div class="ui header">
			  				Step 4: How to write a blog post & publish it
			  			</div>
			  			<div class="description">
			  				<p>Now that your blog is up and running it’s time to actually do some blogging!</p>

			  				<p>Go to the left menu and click on “Posts”.</p>

			  				<p>You will see there is already a post there. This is a default post on every new WordPress blog, and we don’t need it. To delete it click “Trash” just under the post.</p>

			  				<p>To begin writing a new post, click the “Add New” link.
							Publishing Your Blog
							Even after you have written a post your blog may still be showing a “Coming Soon” page.</p>

			  		<div class="content">
			  			<div class="ui header">
			  				Step 5: Promote your blog
			  			</div>
			  			<div class="description">
			  				<p>Creating a well-designed blog and writing great content is just the start. In order to get readers for your blog you will need spend some time promoting it, especially when you first start.</p>

			  				<p>One of my favorite ways to get readers to my blog is to post links on my social media accounts like Facebook and Twitter. This is great, because not only do your friends see the link, but if your friends share the link with their friends it automatically multiplies your readers. If you have created high-quality content on your blog then social media is a great way for your blog to go viral.</p>

			  				<p>In addition to getting new readers to your blog, you will also want to make sure your current readers are coming back. This is where email marketing plays a big role. By collecting the email addresses of your visitors (with their permission of course), you can then notify them when you post something new on your blog. This keeps people coming back to your blog, which not only gives you more readers over time, it also allows you to build a closer relationship with your readers.</p>

			  				Step 6: Make money blogging
			  			</div>
			  			<div class="description">
			  				<p>Once you have put in the effort of creating great blog content and promoting your blog, making money from your blog is actually the easy part.</p>
			  				<p>There are several ways you can make money blogging, from selling your own products or services, to getting paid to write reviews of products on your blog. But the easiest way to make money from your blog is to sell advertising space.</p>
			  				<p>Once you have a popular blog, advertisers will be hounding you for the opportunity to advertise. The best way to take advantage of this situation is to use Google Adsense. They find the advertisers for you and all you have to do is place the Google Adsense code on your blog to start running ads. Google Adsense takes all of the hard work out of the process and just cuts you a check.</p>
