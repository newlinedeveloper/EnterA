				<h2 class="ui blue header">Objective and Problem Solving:</h2>
				<p>
					The offering of any startup should be differentiated to solve a unique customer problem or to meet specific customer needs. Ideas or products that are patented show high growth potential for investors. 	
				</p>
				 

				<h2 class="ui blue header">Market Landscape:</h2>
				<p>
					Market size, obtainable market-share, product adoption rate, historical and forecasted market growth rates, macroeconomic drivers for the market your plans to target.	
				</p>
				 

				<h2 class="ui blue header">Scalability and Sustainability:</h2>
				<p>
					Startups should showcase the potential to scale in the near future, along with a sustainable and stable business plan. They should also consider barriers to entry, imitation costs, growth rate and expansion plans.	
				</p>
				 

				<h2 class="ui blue header">Customers & Suppliers:</h2> 
				<p>
					Clear identification of your buyers and suppliers. Consider customer relationships, stickiness to your product, vendor terms as well as existing vendors.

				</p>
				

				<h2 class="ui blue header">Sales and Marketing:</h2> 
				<p>
					No matter how good your product or service maybe, if it does not find any end use, it is no good. Consider things like sales forecast, targeted audiences, product mix, conversion and retention ratio, etc.  
				</p>
				

				<h2 class="ui blue header">Financial Assessment:</h2>
				<p>
					A detailed financial business model that showcases cash inflows over the years, investments required, key milestones, break-even points and growth rates.

				<div class="description">
					<p>
						A Co-Founder Agreement allows you to set out the equity ownership, initial investments and responsibilities of each Co-Founder. The purpose of the agreement is to make the understanding the co-founders have regarding the functioning of their company and relationship and obligation between co-founders legally binding through a formally written agreement.
					</p>
					
					<p>
						The formation of such an agreement requires an open discussion between the partners regarding their apprehensions, fears, outlook, aspirations and all arrangements involving the start up. The objective of the agreement is to minimize the possibility of debilitating surprises in the future when the company is functional in terms of inter co-founder relationship.
